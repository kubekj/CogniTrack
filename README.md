# CogniTrack ðŸŽ¤ðŸ§ 

AI-powered framework for early dementia detection through vocal biomarkers analysis. Research project investigating speech patterns indicating cognitive decline.

## Overview
Early detection of cognitive decline remains challenging due to the limited accessibility of traditional diagnostic methods. CogniTrack leverages machine learning and voice analysis to develop scalable, non-invasive screening solutions.

## Core Components
- Voice feature extraction pipeline
- ML models for cognitive assessment 
- Clinical validation framework
- Statistical analysis tools
